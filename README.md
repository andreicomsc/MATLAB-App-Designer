# MATLAB App Designer

This project was designed to build familiarity with MATLAB App Designer by developing an interactive application focused around geometric and spatial computations. 

The app enables users to construct 2D/3D geometric objects based on custom input coordinates, perform calculations to determine intersection points, and seamlessly input, load, and export coordinate data. 

To enhance interactivity and data visualisation, I incorporated dynamic buttons and 2D/3D plots, allowing for a more intuitive UI/UX. 

The primary objective was to explore the full potential of MATLAB App Designer, particularly its capabilities for creating interactive interfaces, rendering visual elements, and implementing basic animations with the goal of applying these skills in future software engineering projects.

## Installation, and recommended minimum requirements:
MATLAB version R2022b, "https://uk.mathworks.com/products/matlab/app-designer.html".  
Processor Apple M1 or equivalent.  
Monitor pixel density 183 ppi or higher.
